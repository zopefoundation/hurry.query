CHANGES
=======

2.1 (2017-02-07)
----------------

- Add the possibility to time how long a query takes. It can be
  controlled with the new ``timing`` option to ``searchResults`` or
  the ``HURRY_QUERY_TIMING`` environment variable.

2.0.1 (2016-09-08)
------------------

- Fix log line in Text term for invalid text search.


2.0 (2016-09-07)
----------------

- Add new term: Difference. It does a difference between the first and
  the following terms passed as arguments.

- Add new term: Objects. It creates a result out of the objects passed
  in arguments. It let you mix real objects with existing catalog
  queries (with And, Or or Difference for instance).

- Add an option start to searchResult to skip the first results in the
  results set.

- Extend the result from searchResult. You have addition information
  on the result, including the total number of results without
  start/limit restriction. A method called first() return only the
  first result if available or none.

- Add an option caching to searchResult to cache the result of each
  terms within a Zope transaction, speeding similar queries. If
  disabled, terms will still be cached within the same query.


1.2 (2015-12-16)
----------------

* Add support for an All query.


1.1.1 (2012-06-22)
------------------

* ExtentNone in set.py missed a parameter ``index_id``. Thanks to Danilo
  Botelho for the bug report.

1.1.0 (2010-07-12)
------------------

* Allow the searchResults method of a Query to take an additional keyword
  argument `sort_field` that defines that defines (catalog_name, index_name) to
  sort on. That index in that catalog should implement IIndexSort.

  In addition to this keyword argument, `limit` and `reverse` keyword arguments
  can be passed too, that will limit the sorted resultset and/or reverse its
  order.

* Allow the searchResults method of a Query object to take an additional
  optional context argument. This context will determine which catalog
  the search is performed on.

1.0.0 (2009-11-30)
------------------

* Refresh dependencies. Use zope.catalog and zope.intid instead of
