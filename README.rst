Hurry Query
===========

The hurry query system for the zope.catalog builds on its catalog
indexes, as well as the indexes in zc.catalog. It is in part inspired
by AdvancedQuery for Zope 2 by Dieter Maurer, though has an independent
origin.

You can have a look at the doc tests in the package for more
information regarding the usage.
